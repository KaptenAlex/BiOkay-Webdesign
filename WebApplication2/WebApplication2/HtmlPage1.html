        <h1 class="page-header">What is Bi okay?</h1>
        <p style="font-size:large">
            Bi okay is a completely new type of product. It is a refreshing and organic soft drink with a light fizz and a high content of 7 different lactic acid bacteria
            and probiotic microorganisms. With Bi okay you can reduce your calorie intake and enjoy a natural soft drink.
            Bi okay is available in the 3 flavours: Kiwi/cactus/pineapple, raspberry/liquorice and mandarin/lime/grapefruit.
            All are available in an unsweetened version, while the latter two also in a sweetened version. Only a natural sweetener,
            extracted from the stevia plant is used, so the product is free of sugar and without artificial sweeteners.

        <h1 class="page-header"> What is stevia?</h1>
        <p style="font-size:large">
            Stevia is a herbaceous plant, which stems from South America and has been used for centuries by indigenous peoples as a sweetener.
            It can be cultivated in the Danish climate. In Japan, stevia has been used since the beginning of the 70’s,
            when at the same time the use of the artificial sweetener aspartame was forbidden.
            Today stevia is used in the USA and in Switzerland, and in 2011 it was approved for use in foods within the entire EU.
            Stevia leaves contain a group of substances called steviol glycosides,
            which is a common name for the sweetening components: steviosid, rebaudiosid A (Reb A), rebaudiosid B, rebaudiosid C,
            rebaudiosid D, rebaudiosid E. These natural components sweeten 300-400 times more than sugar.
            They are extracted from the dried leaves in the same way as sugar is won from sugar beet/sugar cane.
            Steviol glycoside has now received the e-number E960. The glycoside that sweetens most is Rebaudiosid A (Reb A)
            Steviol glycosides are heat-stable and can therefore be used for cooking and baking.
            As opposed to sugar they are not converted in the body and are therefore entirely without calorie content.
            The use of stevia instead of sugar can reduce the risk for consequential illnesses like overweight,
            diabetes 2 and high blood pressure.

        <h1 class="page-header"> What is probiotics?</h1>
        <p style="font-size:large">
            The word ”probiotic” is derived from Greek and means ”for life”.
            It covers a range of living microorganisms, which are conferred health-promoting properties through their presence in the gastro-intestinal tract.
            As 70-80% of our immune defence originates from the gastro-intestinal tract probiotics are crucial.
            Clinical studies have shown that the beneficial effect is obtained if at least one billion probiotic microorganisms are consumed per day.
            Probiotic microoorganisms and lactic acid bacteria are everywhere. In the body they are found fx in the oral cavity, the gastro-intestinal tract
            and the urinary tract. In nature they are found among other things on the surface of crops.
            For the last 8000 years humans have treated fx meat, milk and vegetables with these naturally occurring bacteria - a process known as fermentation.
            Modern-day examples of fermented foods include yoghurt, cheese, sauerkraut and olives.
            Probiotics can among other things: promote digestion, ease constipation,
            assist in the resistance of the intestinal mucus against infections, prevent diarrhea,
            assist in the prevention of cholesterol-related cancers, help in lowering cholesterol and blood pressure.
